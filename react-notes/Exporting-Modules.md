# Exporting Modules

- We want to break our app into a lot of small modules
- **Always consider the project structure before coding**
  - This will save you immense amount of time in the long run
- When importing `./` means the current directory
  - Navigate to the file in question and exclude `.js` if it is a Javascript file
  - It's bad practice to import components that aren't being used
